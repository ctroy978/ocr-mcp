That weird, creepy feeling where everything seems familiar \nbut you can't remember why? That's called d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which is French for \"already seen.\" It's one \nof the strangest things the human brain can do, and scientists are still trying to figure out exactly \nwhy it happens.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is really common. Between 60 and 80 percent of people have felt it at least once. \nIt usually only lasts about 10 to 30 seconds, but during that short time, your brain is totally \nconvinced that you've lived through this exact moment before. (Raypole, 2020) The really weird \npart is that you know you haven't, but the feeling is so strong that your mind feels confused. It's \nlike your brain is arguing with itself.\nScientists have been studying d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for a long time. The term was first used back in \n1876 by a man named Emile Boirac. Back then, some people like Sigmund Freud thought it had \nto do with hidden memories. But now, most scientists believe it's actually about how your brain \nphysically works. The big mystery is why we get this feeling of knowing something without any \nactual memory of it. Some scientists think it happens because your brain sees the same thing \ntwice in a split second. Others believe it's about pattern matching, which means your brain \fpsix twenty  3\nnotices that the layout or structure of a new place or moment is similar to something you've seen \nbefore, even if you don\u2019t remember the previous experience. \nThe theory that makes the most sense is that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu happens when two different memory \nsystems in your brain get out of sync with each other. This theory is supported by evidence from \nepilepsy patients, brain scans, memory tests, and age patterns. Your brain has two different \nsystems that work together to help you recognize things. The first system is about familiarity \n(perirhinal cortex). This part of your brain gives you the quick, \"I know this!\" feeling. The \nsecond system is about remembering details (hippocampus). It works slower because it has to \nsearch through all your memories.\nHere's how they normally work together. When you see your friend somewhere, the \nfamiliarity system fires first and says, \"This person is familiar!\" Then your detail system catches \nup and says \"This is ___ from math class.\" But during d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, something goes wrong. The \nfamiliarity system fires and tells you, \"You know them!\" But then the detail system doesn't \nfollow up with any information. You're left with this strong feeling of familiarity but no memory \nto explain it.\nSo why do these two systems fail to sync up? Scientists believe it comes down to timing \nproblems in how your brain processes information. Normally, both memory systems receive \ninformation at almost the same time and work together smoothly. But sometimes, the familiarity \nsignal reaches your conscious awareness slightly before the detailed memory system can process \nthe information. It's like getting the answer before the question. Some experts believe another \ntype of brain malfunction may cause this timing problem. When your brain absorbs information, \nit generally follows a specific path from short-term memory storage to long-term memory \nstorage. The theory suggests that sometimes short-term memories can take a shortcut to long-\fpsix twenty  4\nterm memory storage, making you feel as if you're retrieving a long-ago memory rather than \nsomething that happened in the last second (Raypole, 2020).\nOne of the strongest pieces of evidence comes from people who have epilepsy. Many \nepilepsy patients talk of having really intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu right before they have a seizure. Back in \nthe 1950s, brain surgeon Wilder Penfield did experiments on patients during brain surgery. \nWhen he touched parts of the brain near the memory centers with electricity, patients would \nsuddenly report feeling intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. (Krishna, 2017) This proved that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu isn't mysterious \nor supernatural-it's just the result of certain neurons firing.\nModern technology has given scientists even more tools to study d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. When \nresearchers have scanned people's brains during d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, they've found something interesting. \nThe areas for familiarity show activity, but the areas for detailed memories don't show as much \nactivity. Scientists also use memory tests that support the idea of two different systems. In \n\"remember versus know\" tests, people have to say whether they \"remember\" the item with \ndetails or they just \"know\" it was there without details. These tests show that people can have \nfamiliarity without details.\nAnother good piece of evidence comes from looking at who gets d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and when. D\u00e9j\u00e0 \nvu is most common in teenagers and people in their twenties. As people get older, they \nexperience it less. Young people's brains are still developing, which means things can misfire \nmore easily. As people age, their brains become more stable (McGrogan, 2023).\nStress and tiredness also play a big role. People report having more d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when they're \nexhausted or stressed out (McGrogan, 2023). When your brain is tired, it doesn't work as well. \nAccording to researcher Akira O'Connor, \"When your brain is fatigued like this, your neuronal \nfiring is more likely to be a bit off and result in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" (McGrogan, 2023). There's also \fpsix twenty  5\nevidence about brain chemistry. A chemical called dopamine is involved in the familiarity \nsystem, and drugs that change dopamine levels can affect how often people experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nWhile the two-system theory has the most support, there's also interesting evidence for \npattern matching. Researcher Anne Cleary at Colorado State University has done experiments \nusing virtual reality to study d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (Colorado State University, 2016). Cleary found that people \nwere more likely to get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when they were in a new setting that had the same spatial layout \nas a previously viewed setting (WebMD, 2021). However, pattern matching doesn't explain \neverything. If d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was just about pattern matching, it should happen all the time, not rarely.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu reminds us how weird the human brain really is. Something that seems simple, a \nbrief feeling of familiarity, actually involves multiple brain systems, precise timing, and \nchemical signals. The two-system theory shows us that memory isn't anything but different \nabilities that usually work together smoothly.\nLooking to the future, scientists will keep studying d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as technology improves. \nBetter brain scanners might let us see the exact moment when the two memory systems \ndisconnect. But even as we learn more about how d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu works, some parts of it might always \nremain mysterious. Science can tell us which neurons fire and which chemicals are involved, but \nit might never fully explain why the experience feels so eerie.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a perfect example of how science can take something that seems mysterious \nand explain it in terms of biology and brain function. Your brain is so complex and fast that it \ncan create an impossible feeling just because two signals arrived out of order by a fraction of a \nsecond. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu might be a glitch, but it's a glitch that shows us just how amazing the human \nbrain really is.\fpsix twenty  6\nReferences\nCleary, A. M. (2022, October 3).

Although several explanations have been offered, including \nevolutionary adaptation and general unconscious processing, the present paper argues that \nintuition is best explained as fast, unconscious pattern-matching rooted in accumulated personal \nexperience. Through neuroplasticity, repeated experiences strengthen synaptic connections, \ncreate implicit long-term memories, and build tacit knowledge and heuristics that the brain \naccesses instantly in new situations. Evidence from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and \ndecision-theory research supports the conclusion that individual differences in intuitive accuracy \nare largely attributable to the richness of one\u2019s experiential knowledge base rather than to innate \nor purely evolutionary mechanisms. \nKeywords: intuition, neuroplasticity, implicit memory, pattern-matching, heuristics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \f \nThe Causes of Intuition: Fast Unconscious Reasoning \nIn certain situations, people experience a strong sense of what to do when something feels \nright or wrong. This sensation is commonly known as intuition, an immediate understanding that \narises without conscious reasoning. Several explanations for intuition exist. One attributes it to \nevolutionary adaptation, suggesting that humans retained intuition as a survival mechanism \nenabling rapid responses to threats (Elevate Medical, 2023). Another view holds that intuition \nstems from past experiences: the mind compares the current moment to previous ones and forms \njudgments accordingly (Psychology Today Staff, n.d.). Among these competing explanations, \naccumulated personal experience provides the strongest account. Repeated exposure shapes \nneural connections, forms memories, and creates long-term stored knowledge, all of which \nenable the instantaneous, non-conscious judgments characteristic of intuitive decision-making. \nTo examine this primary explanation in depth, the following sections explore how experience \nphysically reshapes the brain through neuroplasticity, thereby facilitating the pattern-matching \nthat lies at the heart of intuition. \nExperience and Neuroplasticity \nExperience physically reshapes the brain, making intuition possible. Everything \nindividuals encounter, hands-on practice, observation, and social interaction, alters neural \narchitecture. As psychologists have noted, intuition relies on the brain\u2019s power of pattern-\nmatching, rapidly scanning experiences stored in long-term memory for similar situations and \ndelivering in-the-moment judgments (Psychology Today Staff, n.d., para. 9). \fPast experiences are encoded in the brain through neural processes that convert events \ninto lasting patterns (Psychology Today Staff, n.d.). When people first meet someone, for \nexample, the brain performs automatic, rapid evaluations by accessing stored information and \ngenerating immediate impressions. These connections, known as synapses, form the basis of \nlearning. As Richard Huganir, director of the Johns Hopkins Department of Neuroscience, \nexplains, \u201cWhen we learn something, even as simple as someone\u2019s name, we form connections \nbetween neurons in the brain\u201d (as cited in Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2025, \u201cMemory Formation\u201d \nsection, para. 3). This process, neuroplasticity, strengthens or weakens synaptic connections \ndepending on the frequency of exposure (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2025). The more often an \nevent is encountered, the stronger the resulting neural pathways become. Such strengthening \ncreates the foundation for intuitive responses that emerge without deliberate thought. Beyond \nreshaping connections, repeated experiences also encode memories, particularly implicit ones, \nthat operate below conscious awareness and directly fuel intuition. \nImplicit Memories \nExperience forms memories through the biological process of connecting neurons (Johns \nHopkins Medicine, 2025). Memories vary in duration and accessibility: they may be short-term \nor long-term, explicit or implicit (Gasaway, 2016). Short-term memory temporarily holds \ninformation before it is either forgotten or transferred to long-term storage. Long-term memory \nincludes declarative (explicit) memories that can be consciously recalled and implicit memories, \nsuch as habits, skills, or procedural knowledge like driving, that operate without conscious \nawareness (Hollands et al., 2016). \fLong-term memories, especially implicit ones, underpin intuition. Triggers such as \nfamiliarity, emotional significance, or repeated exposure can activate these memories \nunconsciously (Gasaway, 2016). For example, when individuals sense danger in a situation \nwithout understanding why, implicit memories may be responsible. The brain retrieves a prior \nsimilar experience and generates an immediate feeling of unease, even though the person cannot \nconsciously recall the earlier event. As implicit memories accumulate over time, they form the \nfoundation of tacit knowledge and cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, that enable split-second \ndecisions based on stored patterns. \nKnowledge Base and Heuristics \nAs experiences accumulate, they create a rich knowledge base from which intuition \ndraws. Some stored information can be recalled consciously, while other knowledge remains \ninaccessible to conscious articulation yet still influences behavior (Gasaway, 2016, para. 12). \nThis inaccessible knowledge is often described as tacit. Driving offers a familiar example: skilled \ndrivers react intuitively without consciously analyzing every action. Similarly, people frequently \nsense when something feels right or wrong based on intuitive knowledge derived from past \nobservation of others\u2019 reactions (Fox, 2022). \nThese rapid intuitive judgments arise from neural connections forged through repeated \nexposure. The more frequently a situation is encountered, the stronger the associated pathways \nbecome, producing an immediate signal, known as a heuristic, when a similar circumstance \narises again. \fHeuristics are mental shortcuts that allow quick decisions without extensive deliberation \n(Orri, 2015). Common examples include the availability heuristic (judging likelihood by how \neasily examples come to mind), the representativeness heuristic (judging by similarity to a \nprototype), and affect-based heuristics guided by emotion (Orri, 2022, Section 3.2). Tailored to \nspecific contexts, these heuristics reside within the experiential knowledge base. Ultimately, the \nbrain gathers vast amounts of information, constructs patterns from experience, and, when a new \nsituation resembles stored knowledge, produces a judgment or sensation that individuals \nrecognize as intuition. \nConclusion \nIntuition can arise from multiple sources, yet accumulated personal experience emerges \nas the primary and most powerful cause. Through repeated exposure, individuals unconsciously \nshape neural pathways, form lasting implicit memories, and build the long-term knowledge that \nenables instantaneous, non-conscious decisions, the very essence of intuitive thinking. Unlike \nevolutionary explanations, an experience-based perspective accounts for why some people \nconsistently \u201cjust know\u201d the right course of action: the richer and more relevant their history of \nexperiences, the stronger and more accurate their intuition becomes. A deep reservoir of personal \nexperience thus provides the fast, unconscious reasoning people recognize as intuition. \n \n \n \n \fReferences \nElevate Medical. (2023, March 26).
