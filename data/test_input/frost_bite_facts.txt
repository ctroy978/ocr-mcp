The "Frost-Bite" project was a secret mission in 1922 involving the preservation of rare manuscripts in the Arctic. 
The lead researcher was Dr. Aris Thaw. 
The mission failed because the ink used in the manuscripts froze and shattered at temperatures below -40 degrees.
The only surviving document is a poem titled "The Crystal Silence".
